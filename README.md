# Weather Application for Android

This is a Weather Application for Android that provides real-time weather information using the Visual Crossing Weather API. The application displays the current temperature, feels-like temperature, humidity, and a 15-day forecast. It is built using modern Android development practices, including MVVM architecture, data binding, LiveData, Retrofit, and Gson.

## Features
- **Current Weather Information**: Displays the current temperature, feels-like temperature, and humidity based on the userâ€™s location input.
- **15-Day Forecast**: Shows a 15-day weather forecast using a RecyclerView for a clean and scrollable display.
- **Search by Location**: Users can input the name of the location to get detailed weather information.
- **MVVM Architecture**: Follows the Model-View-ViewModel pattern to separate concerns and ensure a modular, maintainable codebase.
- **Data Binding & LiveData**: Uses data binding to efficiently bind UI components to data sources and LiveData to update the UI automatically when the data changes.
- **Retrofit & Gson Converter**: For handling API calls and converting JSON data into Java objects seamlessly.

## Tech Stack
- **Language**: Java
- **Architecture**: MVVM (Model-View-ViewModel)
- **UI Components**: RecyclerView, CardView, ConstraintLayout
- **API**: Visual Crossing Weather API
- **Libraries**: 
  - [Retrofit](https://square.github.io/retrofit/) - For making API calls
  - [Gson Converter](https://github.com/square/retrofit/tree/master/retrofit-converters/gson) - For JSON parsing
  - [LiveData](https://developer.android.com/topic/libraries/architecture/livedata) - For observing data changes
  - [Data Binding](https://developer.android.com/topic/libraries/data-binding) - For binding UI components to data sources

## Setup Instructions
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/weather-application.git
   ```
2. Open the project in **Android Studio**.
3. Add your Visual Crossing Weather API key to the project:
   - Go to `res/values/strings.xml` and replace `YOUR_API_KEY` with your actual API key:
     ```xml
     <string name="apiKey">YOUR_API_KEY</string>
     ```
4. Build and run the application on an Android emulator or a real device.

## Usage
1. Open the app, and enter the location name in the input field.
2. The app will display the current temperature, feels-like temperature, and humidity of the specified location.
3. The 15-day weather forecast will be shown below the current weather data.

## API Reference
- **Visual Crossing Weather API**: The app uses the Visual Crossing API to fetch weather data. You can learn more about it [here](https://www.visualcrossing.com/).

## Future Enhancements
- Add support for user location detection via GPS.
- Improve the UI to make it more visually pleasing and functional, providing a better user experience.
- Add different themes based on weather conditions (e.g., rainy, sunny).
- Include more weather details like wind speed, UV index, and precipitation levels.
